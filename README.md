A Python-based project that generates creative stories from user-provided input sentences. Built using OpenAI's GPT-2 model, this tool allows users to customize various parameters like story length, creativity, and diversity to generate personalized stories.

Description

The Text to Story Maker is a simple yet engaging tool that leverages GPT-2 for text generation. Users can provide an initial sentence or phrase, which acts as the starting point for the story. The program then generates creative, coherent, and sometimes whimsical stories based on user-defined parameters. This project is beginner-friendly and serves as an introduction to text generation using transformers.

Customize output parameters such as:

Maximum story length
Creativity (temperature)
Number of stories to generate
Sampling diversity (top-k)
